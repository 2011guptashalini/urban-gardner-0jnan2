I want to create an app to help out urban Gardner where:

1- User can provide their space dimensions, sunlight conditions, soil information (e.g red soil, sandy soil) and their list of vegetables with quantities needed per day. Then application should tell how many grow bags/pots they need to put for getting required vegetable. For example, if someone says 1 kg of tomatoes per day, then it should tell like 10 grow bags of size 12 inch (ca. 30 cm). If the user provides more vegetables wishlist than their space capacity, then it should clearly tell how much is possible and display a message. For example if user says 1 kg tomato in 20 square feet (1.86 mÂ²) space. Then it should tell that per day 200 grams tomatoes are possible and for that you can put 4 grow bags of 12 inch (ca. 30 cm) size. 

2- Alit should Also it should set a schedule for fertilizer, compost, water etc. User can set this schedule manually per plant or it can take suggestions from AI too. For example for a tomato plant initially vermi compost 50 gram per plant then banana peel etc.
